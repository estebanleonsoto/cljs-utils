# Introduction to dca-tec.js-utils

js-utils is a set of basic utility functions and wrappers for basic java-script and dom-related work.

The intention here is either to wrap js-platform calls with more simple functions. Simple in the sense
of at least more simply and meaningfully named functions, but also in the sense of less parameters
necessary or encapsulating references to the environment, like window, document, etc.
